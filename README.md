I will be developing a logbook application and website.

Pilots would be able to sign up for an account, log in and add a profile photo. Their account details would include:
* First name
* Last name
* Email address
* Phone number
* Date of birth
* Aviation reference number

They would be able to record their licences:
* Licence type
* Date of issue

Their endorsements:
* Aircraft type
* Date of issue

As well as their medical certificates:
* Class
* Issuing doctor
* Date of issue

And of course they would be able to add flights to their logbook including:
* Date
* Aircraft type
* Aircraft registration
* Pilot in command
* Other pilot or crew
* IATA airport codes
* Single or multi-engine
* Hours
